# Java DSA Repository

A well-structured collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in Java**, created for strong problem-solving practice, coding interviews, and placement preparation.

This repository contains categorized implementations and problems from platforms like **LeetCode** and **HackerRank**, along with core DSA topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and algorithms.

## Objectives

* Master Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
* Build strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills
* Prepare for coding interviews and placement drives
* Maintain a clean, topic-wise organized DSA reference
